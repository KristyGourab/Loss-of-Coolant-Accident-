Loss of Coolant Accident 
In a nuclear power plant, the reactor core contains fuel rods that undergo nuclear fission, releasing a large amount of heat. The coolant circulates around these fuel rods, absorbing the heat and carrying it away to be converted into steam, which then drives turbines to generate electricity.
A Loss of Coolant Accident can occur due to various reasons ---
Heat Buildup: With reduced coolant flow, the heat generated by the nuclear reactions cannot be effectively carried away. This can cause a rapid increase in temperature within the reactor core. It can occur when npp loose off-site and on-site power.
For this reason, we can start a DC pump, when temperature of fuel centerline exceed the limiting temperature. So, we use temperture sensor for read the temperture of fuel centerline. 


It is just simple design using ardiuno. In the NPP, complex design is used and also we can remotely monitoring data by using esp32 or other microcontroller.
